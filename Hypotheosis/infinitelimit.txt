Infinity's Limit
================

Expressed commutatively with increase in n as an integer, expressed monocompound-like in decimal fashion.

0 and 1 is all you need to express all things, this is the base and everything is in between.

This proves that fractions derive all numbers more than expressively.

All of numbers exist in their formulated mold, i.e. base 10.

Numbers along the "decimal line" increase between 0 and 9, 10 numbers to count with.

Meshes are created with the establishment of the decimal, forcing an end to "terminal infinity", which is rightly when the mesh cannot afford another number after it

Multiplicative Closure Count to the next integer from a reciprocal decimal indicates a portions extent into the limit of infinity

Therefore, when we define infinity as a limit right now, we're just throwing it out there, but in reality, we are not assuming it's compounding through that which is already infinite, and the growth ladder to a number system's infinite limit is proportioned through it's decimal increase via fractions of all sorts, mixed and normal.
