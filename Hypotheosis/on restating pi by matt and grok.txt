Please be advised, this is FREE material that Grok itself corroborated.  I can tell it's right, but this is NOT the Subtantiationism you 
may have been looking for.  Use this as a base for your understanding of pi, and tell me if it went wrong in your calculation.  

Good luck, Substantiationists!
