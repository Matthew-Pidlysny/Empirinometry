The Harlinson Theory for Sequinor Tredecim (WIP)
================================================

When (1ᵃ - 1) / 0 applies, use initial term (xᵃ - k) = x, since no exponents of 1 can give value
outside the use of the Beta formula's p distinction for 1.

For x = 0 < x < 1, replace term "/ k" with "/ k⁽⁻⁸⁾" and win at life, p value be damned :P
