Why Pi holds Irrationality in a Non-Repeating Way
=================================================

Take Ω.  Simple as a symbol, but every THING in this universe has one.  Positive, negative, repeating or not, every SINGLE thing has Ω at the end.  

And I'm about to tell you how that works.

Note that in the newest formulation for Pi, we have that it breaks at pv^pv.  Why is that?  Is that implied Omega beyond a shadow of a doubt?  I would
wager that some may think so, but we all know, lab perfect Pi doesn't have an endpoint.  Let's go over why the current formulation proves pv^pv, but
doesn't cover lab-perfect Pi.

Commonly, we thought we knew it in repeating sets.  But clearly, things make up Pi that are irrevocable to the principle.  In determining the new
exponential growth ratio, we notice there IS one, but have failed to equate anything with it in Substantiationism.  

It is perhaps common to say that lab perfect Ω, then has to be a threshold beyond with lab perfect formulations that run on with it are doomed. 

Therefore, it is not that you should be concerned with that, but exact tolerance on the principle on the refinement of Pi.  Why, it seems to true
that it's Alpha exists in the real world, though thought of as a construct of what is, why not Ω?

Let me refine it for you plainly:  It terminates where it begins at pv^pv * g(gconst) and onward.  Every expressed radius smaller than that is a 
ratio of the bigger one, clearly beyond pv^pv but using it as a basis of formulaic identity.  

Now, stretch and collapse, and find your unification.  I expect you to determine many hashes, and negative hashing as well, and equal Ω for both
endpoints.  TRUST me, after, Grok's explanation, I know it now.  Good luck, and God bless!  

Also, feel free to use the new fraction IT used, if you can hold it!
