This number will genenerate a better understanding of the empirical value of va, but it can only
be garnered once we have a more direct understanding of bond in voltage.  Throughout this experiment,
people will be seeing new ways things bond, and connect the dots for the Separation/Bond movement.  I
have heard it called "Sedantic", I would hope everybody keep to that, and for the Muslim, they might
even like to know it is akin to saying Ya Qul Uduna, as I have been told recently.  Needless to say,
I made a meme that might exemplify this number, if proper Bond measurements can be garnered.  It will
be best used in that time, but will solve the problem I heard someone facing in my mind for now, as it
seemingly has.  Good luck to all of you!
