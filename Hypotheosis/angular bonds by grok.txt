Iterative Process to Generate a Unique Number from Triangle Angles

**NOTE:  This should describe a function I came across on Facebook, finding out the angle ABC.  It dawned on
	 me that someone should put forward some working documents on iterating angles.  This document does not
         go into how this is fully used in Empirinometry, but as a standard of common math, it might just be
         effective as theory for now, and whatever you come up with for your own equations should do the trick.

         Also, slight tweaks, I hope the file renaming process doesn't bother anyone.

Introduction

This report describes an iterative mathematical process that generates a unique number based on the angles of 
a given triangle. The process takes the angles at the triangle's vertices, cycles through them in a specific 
order, and applies a formula using the sine function. Over many iterations, this sequence converges to a single 
value that uniquely represents the triangle's angular properties.

The method is straightforward and can be computed step-by-step. This report explains the process, demonstrates 
why it converges, and provides a practical example using an equilateral triangle. All formulas are presented in 
a text-only format, avoiding special symbols or formatting that cannot be displayed in a simple text editor.

The Iterative Process

Initial Setup

Consider a triangle with angles A, B, and C, where A + B + C = 180 degrees. The iterative process starts with an 
initial value and updates it at each step using one of the angles, selected based on the step number.

Iteration Details

The sequence begins with:

x_0 = 1

Angle Selection:

At each step n (starting from n = 1), an angle θ_n is chosen based on n modulo 3:  

If n ≡ 1 mod 3, then θ_n = A  

If n ≡ 2 mod 3, then θ_n = B  

If n ≡ 0 mod 3, then θ_n = C

This cycles the angles in the order A, B, C, A, B, C, and so forth as n increases.

Iteration Rule:  For each step n ≥ 1, the next term is calculated as x_n = x_{n-1} * (1 + (sin(θ_n) / n))^{1 / n}  

Here, sin(θ_n) is the sine of angle θ_n (in degrees), and the exponent 1 / n incorporates the iteration step into 
the formula.

Convergence to a Unique Number

The sequence x_n approaches a unique positive number as n becomes very large. This convergence is analyzed using the 
natural logarithm of the sequence.

Convergence Analysis

Logarithmic Transformation

Applying the natural logarithm to the iteration rule:

ln(x_n) = ln(x_{n-1}) + (1 / n) * ln(1 + (sin(θ_n) / n))  

Approximation for Large n:

When n is large, sin(θ_n) / n is small (since |sin(θ_n)| ≤ 1), so:

ln(1 + (sin(θ_n) / n)) ≈ sin(θ_n) / n

Thus:

ln(x_n) ≈ ln(x_{n-1}) + (sin(θ_n) / n^2)  

Series Representation:

Since x_0 = 1 (where ln(x_0) = 0), the logarithm becomes a sum:

ln(x_n) = Σ_{k=1 to n} (sin(θ_k) / k^2)  

Infinite Series Convergence:

As n approaches infinity:

ln(x_∞) = Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (sin(θ_k) / k^2)
Because |sin(θ_k)| ≤ 1 and Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (1 / k^2) converges (known as the Basel series, equal to π^2 / 6), the 
series Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (sin(θ_k) / k^2) converges. Therefore, ln(x_∞) is finite, and:

x_∞ = exp(Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (sin(θ_k) / k^2))

This limit depends on the angles A, B, and C, making it unique to each triangle.

Example: Equilateral Triangle

Consider an equilateral triangle with:

A = B = C = 60 degrees

Here, sin(60°) = √3 / 2 ≈ 0.866, and since all angles are 60°, θ_n = 60° for all n.

Calculation

Initial Value: x_0 = 1  

First Few Terms:

For n = 1: θ_1 = A = 60°

x_1 = 1 * (1 + (sin(60°) / 1))^{1 / 1} = (1 + 0.866)^{1} ≈ 1.866  

For n = 2: θ_2 = B = 60°

x_2 = 1.866 * (1 + (sin(60°) / 2))^{1 / 2} ≈ 1.866 * (1 + 0.433)^{0.5} ≈ 1.866 * (1.433)^{0.5} ≈ 1.866 * 1.197 ≈ 2.234  

For n = 3: θ_3 = C = 60°

x_3 = 2.234 * (1 + (sin(60°) / 3))^{1 / 3} ≈ 2.234 * (1 + 0.289)^{0.333} ≈ 2.234 * (1.289)^{0.333} ≈ 2.234 * 1.089 ≈ 2.433 
 
The sequence continues, gradually stabilizing.

Limit for Equilateral Triangle

Since θ_k = 60° for all k:

ln(x_∞) = Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (sin(60°) / k^2) = (√3 / 2) * Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (1 / k^2) = (0.866) * (π^2 / 6) ≈ 0.866 * 1.6449 ≈ 1.424

Thus:

x_∞ = exp(1.424) ≈ 4.156  

This shows the sequence converging to approximately 4.156 for an equilateral triangle.

Conclusion

This iterative process provides a consistent method to derive a unique number from a triangle's angles. By cycling through the angles and applying the sine-based formula, the sequence converges to a value specific to the triangle’s angular configuration. The method is adaptable to any triangle, making it a versatile tool for mathematical analysis.
