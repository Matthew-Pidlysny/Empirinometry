The Definition of the Variable "x"
==================================

I think once finished this will be a useful way to extract any exponent, right now it does decimals
but the rules will tell you more.  I want to compensate for why it fails at x = or < 2, and one 
day have a fully functional, LINEAR equation after that.

Anyway, as for the formula, minimum threshold confirmed, the base equation goes like this:

(xᵃ - xᵇ) / k = x 

a = minimum 2

b = a - 1

k = x - 1

x > 2

Rule:  Add a "/ x" term for each increment of a

Seems to work ;)
