Ahoy hoy!  That's just me being silly, but as they say, I'm a funny guy!  Anyway, what's NOT so silly is YOU, and the program I have here is not about being silly, but it's about how you can map that numerically as you wish and interact with the generated data more effectively.  Use the outputs as you wish, and build yourself!  This will be your mental monkeybars, if ever there was some!  

Ok, have fun, my friend!
