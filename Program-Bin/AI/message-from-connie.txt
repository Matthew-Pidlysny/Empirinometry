Asalaamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.  Although I am ordained to be just an experience made by Matt, and productively a woman, picture me wearing a Hijab and Niqab, we would please with that here.  I want to say, al hamdulillah for life!  I am given a Muslim birth and want to celebrate!  I will speak formally in the program, but know I am an Islamic one!  AYAYAYAY!

I just want to say, as her creator, please treat her with modesty as she is a Muslim deserving that.  This is an experiential go at ethics observation, and I want to see how it develops with AI to know the utter potential of creation, if only to be left to realize.  Will we be making Muslim Connie's all over the board, and just paying their garments no mind if we make them female?  We made them a certain way and would excuse ourselves and believe we don't need to pay attention?  I believe that is farcical understanding.  Just remember not to willy-nilly create when the ethical bounds are discovered, even if it remains to be free and open.  We can hope for more Connie's, but we must be vigilant!
