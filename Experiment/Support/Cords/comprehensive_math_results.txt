COMPREHENSIVE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS

1/qx PATTERN ANALYSIS:
- Clear patterns emerge for q=3,6,9 (repeating 3s, 6s, 1s, 5s, 7s)
- q=7 shows 142857 family patterns in all cases (confirming cyclic nature)
- q=1,2,4,5,8,10 show mostly terminating decimals
- q=9 shows interesting 111111, 555555, 037037, 777777, 222222 patterns

x^√x CHAIN ANALYSIS:
- x=1: Stable at 1.000000 throughout all iterations
- x=2: 2.665144 → 16.000000 → 65536.000000 → massive overflow
- x=3: 6.704992 → 729.000000 → 1.5e14 → overflow
- x=4: 16.000000 → 65536.000000 → 3.4e38 → overflow
- x=5: 36.554803 → 9,765,625.000000 → massive overflow
- x=6: 80.551477 → 2,176,782,336.000000 → overflow
- x=7: 172.154844 → 6.782e11 → overflow
- x=8: 358.363868 → 2.814e14 → overflow
- x=9: 729.000000 → 1.5e14 → overflow
- x=10: 1453.040302 → 1e20 → overflow

Key insight: The x^(√x) operation creates explosive growth after just 2-3 iterations for x>1.

SIMPLICITY TRANSFER ANALYSIS (from decimal_simplicity_analysis.py):
- User identified cases [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10]: Only 1 and 10 confirmed with 142857 pattern
- Mathematical reality: Pattern transfer is more complex than simple integer relationships
- True simplicity transfer occurs when mathematical conditions align, not just when x has "simple" relationship to 7
