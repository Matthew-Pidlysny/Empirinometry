OK, so we covered alot.  Here is the link to the conversation with SuperNinja that spawned this great thing, you can access all files archived by playing the demonstration and then 
pausing it a short way through, then clicking on the folder icon at the top right, selecting whichever file you want to download and access.

I find it convenient to say that my theory about 13 is only picking up right now, I just want to unify math now in certain ways and Empirinometry, as I've found, is the way to get 
there.  It can be our "wild container" and define 2 as a wild factor, I will work on that understanding in time.  God bless, and good luck!
