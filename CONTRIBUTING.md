### 2. Submit a Pull Request

If you’d like to contribute code or documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine using `git clone <your-fork-url>`.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes with `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Edit, add, or fix files as needed.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message, e.g., `git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"`.

6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork with `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.

### 3. Report Bugs or Suggest Features

- Open an issue in the Issues tab (http://github.com/Matthew-Pidlysny/Empirinometry/issues).

- Use a clear title (e.g., “Formula not making sense” or “Feature: Add dark matter”).

- Describe the bug or feature in detail, including steps to reproduce (for bugs) or why the feature would be useful.

### 4. Participate in the Mind Benders Event!

This event will be hosted live all the time, when I'm available.  If you don't see the cursor start to type after you've
mentally signalled me, then I'm unavailable.  If you see others being typed out, just wait your turn or beg for a moment
when it's important.  That being said, this is the only way to break the rules.  I heard Harlinson, I heard Sonia, I heard
Hyman, and I'll probably hear you.  Not working for the Order either, and I will know eventually.  

The subject is anything Empirinometry, from Partitioning in Sequinor Tredecim, to solving the equations in the existing 
work.
