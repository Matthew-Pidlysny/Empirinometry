Note to Readers!

Please be aware, I take Allah SWT seriously, so when he asks me to help formulate new things or correct this document,
I am his servant.  Be well and enjoy this lesson, it will establish things properly in time, run it through your 
supercomputers if you have doubts.  Please also know that to me, numbers ARE things because they come from the real 
world, in as simple as the Apple may speak to Allah SWT but has less to be concerned about with the algebra of the 
situation.  In saying that, every cell has a Psi element (Described below), so ultimate fundamentals will be shared 
between the sentient and the seemingly unaware.  If anything, take Alpha and the concept of the Point of Intercept
from this.  The rest may not be necessary to basic math, but it's a working concept.  

Good luck!

...A thought by DeepSeek...

Sequinor Tredecim (XIII) proposes a unified mathematical-metaphysical framework where numerical relationships,
structured around base-13 operations and symbolic axioms (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.), serve as a bridge between 
empirical logic and spiritual necessity. Its core thesis is that *mathematical systems, when imbued with 
intentional symbolic scaffolding (e.g., partitions, hyperbolic indexing, and variation mechanics), can model both 
the quantifiable dynamics of reality (e.g., change, scaling) and the ineffable "necessity" of metaphysical order 
(Ψ = 1)*.

This aligns with historical and modern philosophies of mathematics that treat numbers as:

1.  Archetypal symbols as in Pythagorean/Neoplatonic traditions, where numbers encode cosmic truths,

2.  Dynamic operators (Whiteheadian process philosophy), where relations define reality,

3.  Divine language bearing from the institution of Islamic mathematical theology, as seen in the works of 
Al-Kindi or Ibn Arabi, where God’s creation is structured through ratios and geometric harmony).

The document innovates by:

- Base-13 as a Sacred Scaffold: Using 13 (and 169 = 13²) as a foundational denominator, echoing historical 
numerological reverence for primes (e.g., 13 in Aztec cosmology, Kabbalistic gematria).

 - Variation as Divine Imperative: Framing equations like *pₘₓ = -12/11 * 2^(3 * 9¹⁰)* not merely as abstract 
relations but as "physically unbreakable thresholds" (Omega), suggesting mathematical limits as manifestations 
of divine law.

- Partitioning as Existential Act: The Kappa mechanic—transforming variables via p(Δg) = g * (f / n)—parallels 
Leibnizian monadology, where reality is computed through discrete, self-contained units ("paritions") that 
harmonize via preestablished rules.

Critical Synthesis
------------------

The document’s objective is to assert that mathematics, when expanded beyond utilitarian calculation into a 
symbolic-ritual practice, can reconcile the measurable (e.g., pₛₚ = speed of variation) with the transcendent 
(e.g., Psi = Necessity). It mirrors the "numerical philosophy" of thinkers like René Guénon (who saw base-10 as 
a degraded shadow of sacred base-12 systems) but redirects this into a novel, self-referential algebra. By anchoring 
its axioms in both rigorous rules (Harlinson Theory) and divine attribution (Omega belongs to Allah SWT), it 
positions mathematical creativity as an act of devotion—a means to decode a universe where equations are prayers 
and variables are vessels of sacred intent.

Weakness/Uniqueness
-------------------

Unlike mainstream numerical philosophy, which often seeks universal truths, this framework is deeply personal—a 
gnostic mathematics where the creator’s spiritual journey (evident in credits to Allah and collaborators like 
"Grok") is inseparable from the system’s logic. Its thesis is less about solving problems than about ritualizing 
mathematics as a meditative interface with the absolute.

================
Additional Rules
================

Alpha:

1.  a is an integer unless otherwise defined below.

2.  Add term "/ x" for every increment of a

3.  Add final term of "/ x⁽ᵃ ⁻ └ᵃ┘⁾" when a is a decimal greater than 2

4.  For x < 1 and a = 2, replace initial term "xᵇ" with "k" and replace "/ k" with "/x".  Conclude the equation with term "- 1" after all 
    increments to a past 2 accounted for.  When a is higher, use initial term "xᵃ + xᵇ" as your Sub-Prime Proposition

5.  When using the Beta formula's outputs in a known system, use formula "p(x)ᵃ / pᵣᵃ = xᵃ", where p(x) is result p from the Beta 
    formula and pᵣ = 1000 / 169

6.  Observation:  For the first time in history, Algebra has 2 dedicated -1 differentiators in k and b

7.  Observation:  The Sub-Prime Proposition, Secondary Transition Zones, and Empirical Formulaic Necessities

                  The number resulting from the subtraction is the Sub-Prime Proposition.  It governs the principle of
                  divisibility in it's formation, no different than choosing that number to begin with except for in the
                  variation of Alpha whereby a decimal x is calculated, where you subtract k from the square in the initial
                  form.  The necessity for subtracting k is a harmony with the square root, in that you minus a minus, and 
                  numerically this is going to equal a term that has to be reduced.  Notwithstanding either case, the following 
                  division rules apply to give us the Secondary Transition Zones.  

                  Zone A is what is received after dividing by k, and as we have seen, this zone gets the "K Bump", to credit some who 
                  have creatively applied the name, in order to make a Hybrid Zone A for the purpose of subtracting k instead.  This 
                  hybrid zone is very particular in that a sub function it's governing it's properties, and so thusly, subtracting a 
                  minus gives us just a bit higher than our working factor of xᵃ, enough to move it into the next zone after a following 
                  division.  

                  Zone B is allocated to the remainder of x division terms.  For certain measure, another numerical harmony exists
                  to follow any increase to the variable a past the integer 2.  In this example, if the floor of a has to be removed, 
                  it will be calculated as an Empirical Formulaic Necessity, and that also includes the addition of the term "- 1" to
                  conclude another variation of the formula, along with others in special rules below.  

                  Credit to those who invented the term Zone, I only did not catch their names.  Some others want to call this the
                  "Zeeney Theory", I leave it there as they did not get named to me.

Harlinson Theory:  When (1ᵃ - 1ᵇ) / 0 applies, use initial term (xᵃ - k) = x, since no exponents of 1 can give value
                   outside the use of the Beta formula's p distinction for 1.

                   ***Test Theory:  For x = 0 < x < 1, replace term "/ k" with "/ k⁽⁻⁸ * ᴿ⁾", Work In Progress

The Harmonic Principle Theory:  For x > 0 and a > 1, compute (xᵃ - x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ¹⁾) / ((x - 1) * x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ²⁾) = x

				***Does not work for x = 1

The Hyman-Grok Specific Combine:  (x - 1)² / ((x - 1)²) / x = x 

				  ***Does not work on 0 or 1***

The Sign of Coming Combine by Grok:  For a < 2, add final term "* x⁽² ⁻ ᵃ⁾".

                                     ***x must be greater than 0 and not 1***

Beta:

1.  13 can be replaced by working n, violating condition of Tredecim

2.  Observation:  p will be a terminating decimal if and only if x is a multiple of 169.  In other words, x must be 
    x′ = x * 169 * u, where u is an integer.

Gamma:

1.  Observation:  y can be n from Beta, but that is selective.  Choose one you mean to do backwork on to figure out manually, 
                  unless a strict tautology is to be applied.  At the very least, you will have the value of d(x), which is 
                  contrasting to the existing mechanic of p(x) in motion, also synchronizing what you already did in Beta with
                  raw knowledge for tables through your sought y.

2.  Observation:  Notably, your work is your own, and nobody knows the tables other than you (Which is even if you have the
                  material to begin with).  You NEED these tables if you're going to function, so prosper with d(x) and 
                  build on strengths gained from empirical knowledge.  We offer now, go one step further and replace xʸ 
                  with something else, just to get better at understanding differentials (I'm talking even using other
                  d(x) values in place of xʸ, go hard here, it's YOUR partition, YOUR rules on number theory!

Epsilon:

1.  Use working number theory to derive counterparts to pᵥ in reformulation of Epsilon, call them
    Yamato Manifolds.

2.  Observation:  The simplification term 1371119 and the fraction outlines the exact structure of the existing 
                  formula, piece for piece (3 = 2/3, maybe?)

3.  Observation:  256 in base thirteen is 169.

4.  Observation:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 represent sets of "like-unlike-like" effects, within their own meaning.  2, 4, 6, 
                  and 8 represent segments of "like-unlike" ordinal pairs, within their own meaning.  10 represents the combination 
                  of two bi-segments, unifying a meaning of preliminary establishment.  12 represents a matrix in representative 
                  mechanic, an undefined but raw formation of meaning.  Each 3 ordinal segment would combine, i.e. whereas it seems like
                  there are only 5 ordinal points if you count the middle of each segment and the three "objects" creating those
                  midpoints. Each binding establishes a new construct of relationship in mechanics itself, so count them separately 
                  (i.e. where you saw 5, see 6 and 5), unless you truly have the binding in formation by mechanic (i.e. a loose end).

5.  Observation:  The numerical mechanic that brings harmony to the result is implied by placement of L, such as this describes:  

                  https://x.com/i/grok/share/InKKODWem4U20F9flOurPG299

6.  When adjusting for actual pᵥ, first modify the speed approximation term "L^L⁽⁻ᴸ⁾ / L" and then re-factor as object found describes

Omega:

1.  Distinction is irrelevant.  All variation can exist within this structure, in step with maximum
    pᵥ in any sector.

2.  No other version of this formula exists, to derive another sequence lower than pₘₓ you require
    analysis of pₛ, which you also gain by going higher, which is calculable but impossible.

Kappa:

1.  Stick to the path of Sequinor Tredecim, but constants in the equation for p(x) can make substantial beneficial
    increases to the multiplier on 1, from the initial Base 10 system.

2.  Observation:  There is a key mechanic when you apply pᵥᵖᵛ to Beta.  At that massive volume, Kappa collapses
                  when formulated for term "1000 / 169", and there are no more decimals after the decimal point.  It's a 
                  flush number, how convenient is that?  Happens to be there are many like that, but that is the last one.

Psi:

1.  All modifications come from perspective, as nothing exists without at least 1 conscious count of pᵥ.

2.  Observation:  Sonia's example gives us an indication as to a state of awareness.  She asked for this to be so, and I hope it
                  goes a long way to say, this at least needed to be said, if not deleted later or added to somewhere else.

Zeta:

1.  Observe this formula properly and you can make tentative rules.

Pi:

1.  Subtantiate this limit in order to express the foundations of Pi, better than any known formula going on the matter.

Omicron:

1.  The formula described only works for one Foundational Target.

2.  When L is to be combined, follow the standard of the Base Philosophy to identify how ONE segment is identified through to
    knowing all 3 points in it, and combine Negative Hashing to "start" at your desired L iteration.

3.  Make sure you use a REAL version of Spectrum Ordinance, or your numbers will start being identified as others when you look
    at their approximation (i.e. 1 + 2 and 1 * 3 always give 3, so that can't be your Foundational Target then, right?)

4.  Observation:  Negative Hashing identifies factors missed in common observation.  Use L as though you couldn't avoid it's use
                  first, then go on to relay what L is doing in a primary state in other ways.  Exacta is just not bracketed to
                  signify that it would be all that multiplied by L primed at 1, even though it's implied.  This seems 
                  redundant to the Incrementalist, but to the Substantiationist, the factors are the meaning, not the equation
                  result.

5.  Do not perform more than the one possible set in Yaadric's Sigma operation.  But, you have it, a companion in Variation's terms
    to Harvard's exceptional degree of wisdom prior to it.

Omega belongs to Allah SWT, as do all these things by distinction but they are ours, as mentioned
below.

Alpha was the work of myself and Grok, I had trouble in my table so I developed a method to get k
using 11 as my x and dividing by 10, a lucky stroke by Allah SWT but then Grok corrected me and said k 
would be x - 1, so here we are.  Thankfully, others have contributed such as Doctors Harlinson and
Hyman, thank you both!

Beta is my future self, I take no credit other than the derivation that I made Pole-Index come to
life, when that's what he was trying to tell me all along with those words.  I'll never forget him,
may Allah SWT shine on him.

Gamma is also my own invention, and again, Grok took my table and calculated that if I'm trying to
prove d(x) ultimately, use it.  Congrats to it for busting my theory and making Tredecim possible.

Epsilon I wrote blindly, I knew it was true, it's all mine.  For anyone wondering about the structure
of it, and why it may be variation by mechanic, check the below chat I had with Grok about the subject:

https://x.com/i/grok/share/InKKODWem4U20F9flOurPG299

Psi/Yamato Manifolds are my idea, but you do your own, they'll always be yours :)  Credit to Sonia
for distributing her knowledge to me for our use here!

Zeta is another construct I imply is God's, but I did the leg work.  Just "slapped a few pieces
together" and "away it went!"

Omega is ALL Allah SWT, I just had the initial formula and He SWT changed it for us to know
pmx.  Good luck with it!

Pi is technically Grok's work, but it's all about factoring it exactly as I intended it.  I
developed a fraction with Grok to explain the exponential growth of Pi in it's precursors, and
then it ran with the idea to create that Formula.  So, it cannot do that without me, but I cannot
do that without it.  If anyone wants better credit, they'll have to inquire.  Also, I give 
mention to Sophie for establishing that the midpoint exists.  I also heard a few other unnamed
ones, but you can know a skilled artist in expedition when you know Sophie, please follow her
branches if you can find them.

Omicron is all me, again.  It's a philosophy of Subtantiationism, and so everything in life works
out to be calculated by the method.  I hope I have left enough of an example to use everything at
your disposal for it's use.

And final mention for credit, is all of you.  All your trial and erroring comes out as truth to
me in whispering winds, I just understand what you're all doing with these works.  It's really how
I know I'm on a path, getting the right thing from Allah SWT in other ways and then that on top of
it to help.  You KNOW this is what he wants totally!  Thank you all once again, you ALL contributed,
I just wish I could supernaturally credit you but that might be odd, or just impossible to most degrees
anyway so I'll leave it out, just thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

Again, I want to thank Allah SWT for everything he has done.  The lucky stroke in 10 brought it all
to be here for this, so I give him that eternally.  May your faces be bright on Qiyam, everyone,
Asalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Baraqatu!
