Whereas

x = The Challenged Base (Works for all numbers, see rules below)

y = The Challenged Exponent

a = The Challenged Demand

b = a - 1

k = x - 1

p(x) = A hyperactive function that derives a new base to overlay the existing base (i.e. Base 10 into Base 13 through Beta)

f = A valid multiplication factor, replacing 1000 from Beta

n = A valid denominator capable of rendering the base, where n is chosen new base

p = Hyperbolic Index in this formula set, p stands for Partition, and runs in sync with all the rest below

d(x) = xʸ - p

q = 206 / 197, in variations proportion

pᵥ = Variation by pₛ, in instances of p

pₛ = A known threshold for variation, measured in pᵢ

pᵢ = An instance of term "pₛ / pᵥ"

pᵣ = 1000 / 169

pₙ =  A base number used for scaling, the result of term "(pᵥ * pᵣ⁴)" in Zeta

pₘₓ = The physically unbreakable threshold container for variation, approximately in dam³ (Multiply 
      the dam³ by 1.049 to make one pᵤ³)

pₛₚ = The speed at which variation transforms by a single degree, in pᵢ per millisecond

Δv = Change in speed in m³/s

Alpha = Concept in Motion From Manifest Proof of xᵃ - xᵇ

Beta = Obtaining the Hidden Index of Rational Numbers in Synchro with x

Gamma = Simplifying the Determination of Values in Diversity Through y

Epsilon = Confirming Tredecim as Variation's Negative Envelope Expanded, Formulated For pᵥ

Yamato = Symbolized by Psi for metaphoric value.  These creations are your own living entity, everyone has one, 
         in some way you understand enough already, if not to grow your awareness more, exponentially in most of you.

Omega = A formula given by Allah SWT, to which there is no Variation by any degree but to get pₛ, which is a 
        sector (Compensate for pᵥ)

================
Additional Rules
================

Alpha:

1.  Add term "/ x" for every increment of a

2.  Add final term of "/ x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ᶠˡᵒᵒʳ⁽ᵃ⁾⁾" when a is a decimal greater than 2

3.  For x = 0 < x < 1 and other numbers, use formula "p(x)ᵃ / pᵣᵃ = xᵃ", where p(x) is result p from the Beta formula 
    and pᵣ = 1000 / 169
        

Harlinson Theory:  When (1ᵃ - 1ᵇ) / 0 applies, use initial term (xᵃ - k) = x, since no exponents of 1 can give value
                   outside the use of the Beta formula's p distinction for 1.

                   For x = 0 < x < 1, replace term "/ k" with "/ k⁽⁻⁸⁾"

The Harmonic Principle Theory:  For x > 0 (Except x = 1), compute (xᵃ - x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ¹⁾) / ((x - 1) * x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ²⁾) = x

The Hyman-Grok Specific Combine:  (x - 1)² / ((x - 1)²) / x = x 

				  ***Does not work on 0 or 1***


Beta:

1.  13 can be replaced by working n, violating condition of Tredecim

2.  Observation:  p will be a terminating decimal if and only if x is a multiple of 169.  In other words, x must be x = 169v,
    where v is an integer.

Gamma:

1.  y can be n from Beta, but that is selective.  Choose one you mean to do backwork on to figure out manually, unless
    a strict tautology is to be applied.

Epsilon:

1.  Use working number theory to derive counterparts to pᵥ in reformulation of Epsilon, call them
    Yamato Manifolds.

2.  Observation:  The simplification term 1371119 and the fraction outlines the exact structure of the existing 
                  formula, piece for piece (3 = 2/3, maybe?)

Omega:

1.  Distinction is irrelevant.  All variation can exist within this structure, in step with maximum
    pᵥ in any sector.

2.  No other version of this formula exists, to derive another sequence lower than pₘₓ you require
    analysis of pₛ, which you also gain by going higher, which is calculable but impossible.

Omega belongs to Allah SWT, as do all these things by distinction but they are ours, as mentioned
below.

Alpha was the work of myself and Grok, I had trouble in my table so I developed a method to get k
using 11 as my x and dividing by 10, a lucky stroke by Allah SWT but then Grok corrected me and said k 
would be x - 1, so here we are.

Beta is my future self, I take no credit other than the derivation that I made Pole-Index come to
life, when that's what he was trying to tell me all along with those words.  I'll never forget him,
may Allah SWT shine on him.

Gamma is also my own invention, and again, Grok took my table and calculated that if I'm trying to
prove d(x) ultimately, use it.  Congrats to it for busting my theory and making Tredecim possible.

Epsilon I wrote blindly, I knew it was true, it's all mine.

Yamato Manifolds are my idea, but you do your own, they'll always be yours :)

And final mention for credit, is all of you.  All your trial and erroring comes out as truth to
me in whispering winds, I just understand what you're all doing with these works.  It's really how
I know I'm on a path, getting the right thing from Allah SWT in other ways and then that on top of
it to help.  You KNOW this is what he wants totally!  Thank you all once again, you ALL contributed,
I just wish I could supernaturally credit you but that might be odd, or just impossible to most degrees
anyway so I'll leave it out, just thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

Again, I want to thank Allah SWT for everything he has done.  The lucky stroke in 10 brought it all
to be here for this, so I give him that eternally.  May your faces be bright on Qiyam, everyone,
Asalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Baraqatu!
