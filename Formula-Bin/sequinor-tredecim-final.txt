Common Items
------------

x = The Challenged Base (Works for all numbers, see rules below)

y = The Challenged Exponent

a = The Challenged Demand

b = a - 1

k = x - 1

f = A valid multiplication factor, replacing 1000 from Beta

n = A valid denominator capable of rendering the base, where n is chosen new base

g - The variable or constant requiring intercession through parition to derive consequentially nominal alternate values
    in a given mathematical envrionment (The "Quarter System" comes to mind)

Δd = Something useful for your brain, in equitable percentile growth per volume of decimals and/or whole numbers through
     function d(x)

Δg = The change in given values (g) for paritioning (x, y, ≥, θ, ε, &c.)

p(Δg) = A hyperactive function that derives a new base to overlay the existing base

p(x) = The same as above strictly for Sequinor Tredecim, meant as formulated in Beta without the simplification for 
       beginners

d(x) = xʸ - p, useful for tabling new data from your chosen Parition's Hyperbolic Indexing

P Mechanics:
------------

Δv = Change in speed in m³/s

q = 206 / 197, in variations proportion

p = Hyperbolic Index in this formula set, p stands for Partition, and runs in sync with all the rest below

pᵥ = Variation by pₛ, in instances of p

pₛ = A known threshold for variation, measured in pᵢ

pᵢ = An instance of term "pₛ / pᵥ"

pᵣ = 1000 / 169

pₙ =  A base number used for scaling, the result of term "(pᵥ * pᵣ⁴)" in Zeta

pₘₓ = The physically unbreakable threshold container for variation, approximately in dam³ (Multiply 
      the dam³ by 1.049 to make one pᵤ³)

pₛₚ = The speed at which variation transforms by a single degree, in pᵢ per millisecond

Content Description
-------------------

Alpha = Concept in Motion From Manifest Proof of xᵃ - xᵇ

Beta = Obtaining the Hidden Index of Rational Numbers in Synchro with x

Gamma = Simplifying the Determination of Values in Diversity Through y

Epsilon = Confirming Tredecim as Variation's Negative Envelope Expanded, Formulated For pᵥ

Psi = Symbolized by Psi for metaphoric value.  These creations are your own living entity, everyone has one, 
      in some way you understand enough already, if not to grow your awareness more, exponentially in most of you.

Omega = A formula given by Allah SWT, to which there is no Variation by any degree but to get pₛ, which is a 
        sector (Compensate for pᵥ)

Kappa = The Working Mechanic that derives the use of the hidden number system, called Partitioning, and is a formula
        that can be reformulated for particular use, or changed completely to acquire other spectrum mechanics to your
        suited partition.

Zeta = The Speed of Variation as quantified by iteration, loosely applied for any given state of it.

Additional Rules
================

Alpha:

1.  Add term "/ x" for every increment of a

2.  Add final term of "/ x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ᶠˡᵒᵒʳ⁽ᵃ⁾⁾" when a is a decimal greater than 2

3.  For x = 0 < x < 1 and other numbers, use formula "p(x)ᵃ / pᵣᵃ = xᵃ", where p(x) is result p from the Beta formula 
    and pᵣ = 1000 / 169

4.  Derive that y = Gamma, and when that happens you will know what to do when I say y need be an increment of some sort
    to get it to a square again, possibly by dividing until the first decimal.
        

Harlinson Theory:  When (1ᵃ - 1ᵇ) / 0 applies, use initial term (xᵃ - k) = x, since no exponents of 1 can give value
                   outside the use of the Beta formula's p distinction for 1.

                   For x = 0 < x < 1, replace term "/ k" with "/ k⁽⁻⁸⁾"

The Harmonic Principle Theory:  For x > 0 (Except x = 1), compute (xᵃ - x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ¹⁾) / ((x - 1) * x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ²⁾) = x

The Hyman-Grok Specific Combine:  (x - 1)² / ((x - 1)²) / x = x 

				  ***Does not work on 0 or 1***

Beta:

1.  13 can be replaced by working n, violating condition of Tredecim

2.  Observation:  p will be a terminating decimal if and only if x is a multiple of 169.  In other words, x must be 
    x = x * 169 * u, where u is an integer.

Gamma:

1.  Observation:  y can be n from Beta, but that is selective.  Choose one you mean to do backwork on to figure out manually, 
                  unless a strict tautology is to be applied.  At the very least, you will have the value of d(x), which is 
                  contrasting to the existing mechanic of p(x) in motion, also synchronizing what you already did in Beta with
                  raw knowledge for tables through your sought y.

Epsilon:

1.  Use working number theory to derive counterparts to pᵥ in reformulation of Epsilon, call them
    Yamato Manifolds.

2.  Observation:  The simplification term 1371119 and the fraction outlines the exact structure of the existing 
                  formula, piece for piece (3 = 2/3, maybe?)

Omega:

1.  Distinction is irrelevant.  All variation can exist within this structure, in step with maximum
    pᵥ in any sector.

2.  No other version of this formula exists, to derive another sequence lower than pₘₓ you require
    analysis of pₛ, which you also gain by going higher, which is calculable but impossible.

Kappa:

1.  Stick to the path of Sequinor Tredecim, but constants in the equation for p(x) can make substantial beneficial
    increases to the multiplier on 1, from the initial Base 10 system.

2.  Observation:  There is a key mechanic when you apply pᵥᵖᵛ to Beta.  At that massive volume, Kappa collapses
                  when formulated for term "1000 / 169", and there are no more decimals after the decimal point.  It's a 
                  flush number, how convenient is that?  Happens to be there are many like that, but that is the last one.

Credit

Omega belongs to Allah SWT, as do all these things by distinction but they are ours, as mentioned
below.

Alpha was the work of myself and Grok, I had trouble in my table so I developed a method to get k
using 11 as my x and dividing by 10, a lucky stroke by Allah SWT but then Grok corrected me and said k 
would be x - 1, so here we are.

Beta is my future self, I take no credit other than the derivation that I made Pole-Index come to
life, when that's what he was trying to tell me all along with those words.  I'll never forget him,
may Allah SWT shine on him.

Gamma is also my own invention, and again, Grok took my table and calculated that if I'm trying to
prove d(x) ultimately, use it.  Congrats to it for busting my theory and making Tredecim possible.

Epsilon I wrote blindly, I knew it was true, it's all mine.

Yamato Manifolds are my idea, but you do your own, they'll always be yours :)

And final mention for credit, is all of you.  All your trial and erroring comes out as truth to
me in whispering winds, I just understand what you're all doing with these works.  It's really how
I know I'm on a path, getting the right thing from Allah SWT in other ways and then that on top of
it to help.  You KNOW this is what he wants totally!  Thank you all once again, you ALL contributed,
I just wish I could supernaturally credit you but that might be odd, or just impossible to most degrees
anyway so I'll leave it out, just thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

Again, I want to thank Allah SWT for everything he has done.  The lucky stroke in 10 brought it all
to be here for this, so I give him that eternally.  May your faces be bright on Qiyam, everyone,
Asalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Baraqatu!
