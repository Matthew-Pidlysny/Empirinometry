The Student's Guide To The Hyperbolic Index
===========================================

Hello class!  First, we need to evolve our x.  Let's find it now using the first formula:

(((28561 - 2197) / k) / x) / x = x

WHEREAS

x is your challenged base number for all equations

k = x - 1

Hooray, we have it!  How easy was that?  Now for the easier part, solving for a.  Let's do it now
using the second formula:

((x / n) * 1000) / n = a

WHEREAS

a is the raw result of the second equation

n is any chosen positive whole number that works in these three equations

Perfect!  We have our two values.  Now, using everything you have, we need to find out the exponent
for the answer to our quiz!  Let's try now, using the final formula:

62,748,517 = a + d(x)

WHEREAS

y is your challenged exponent

d(x) = x^y - a

Now you've done it!  We have our chosen exponent!  Write down you final answer as x^y and you're done, hand in your work!  Good job, too, keep it up, you're on a roll with this one, slugger!
