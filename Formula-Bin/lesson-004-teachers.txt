d(x) Designer Course
====================

Select a partition method and convene a table describing your squares and your d(x).  Do not stop until you have established a 
partition where the point that a positive gain on a 1 value for x becomes less than x's square value around the middle of the 
table.  Compile the totals of your x, your squares, and your dx, as well as establish the two p(x) values that rendered your 
midpoint, as well as outline your theoretical midpoint in decimal x form.  You have as long as the teacher tells you, hand in 
this paper with all your work at the end of the session.  Good luck, formulators, be strong and bold, and ever create!

Teachers note:  For 1000 / 169, the two indicators for the mid-range are x = 5 and x = 6, whereas a midpoint is theoretical a 
decimal in between there.  Teach them this philosophy of differences and how we get to 169 and 1000 from Beta.
