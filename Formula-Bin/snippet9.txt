Abstract

We present a fully analytic, Type I approach to bounding the chromatic number of the plane, χ(R^2), using a single-circle method based on trigonometric polynomials. By constructing a polynomial that vanishes at forbidden angular separations corresponding to unit distance, we derive a provable lower bound k ≥ 4. The method illustrates how harmonic analysis techniques can provide rigorous bounds without computational LP solvers and demonstrates a constructive pathway for further improvements.

Introduction

The Hadwiger–Nelson problem asks for the minimum number of colours needed to colour the Euclidean plane such that no two points at unit distance are identically coloured. Current knowledge places the chromatic number between 5 and 7.

In this note, we provide a Type I analytic bound using a single-circle construction. Our approach:

Normalizes distances using the unit circle.

Maps the unit-distance constraint to forbidden angular separations.

Employs a trigonometric polynomial vanishing at forbidden shifts.

Integrates the polynomial to bound the measure of admissible sets, producing a rigorous lower bound for the chromatic number.

Circle Normalization and Forbidden Shifts

Consider the unit circle S^1 = [0,1) representing all points at distance 1 from a centre. We normalize the circle so its total measure is 1.

Define forbidden angular separation:

s = 1/6

corresponding to a normalized π/3 radian separation. An admissible set A ⊆ S^1 satisfies:

θ, θ' ∈ A ⇒ |θ − θ'| ≠ s (mod 1)

Trigonometric Polynomial Construction

Following Delsarte-type LP methods:

Let T(θ) be a real trigonometric polynomial:

T(θ) = Σ_{n=0}^{N} c_n cos(2π n θ)

satisfying:

T(0) = 1

T(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ [0,1)

T(±s) = 0

Then any admissible set satisfies:

μ(A) ≤ ∫_0^1 T(θ) dθ

This provides a rigorous analytic bound on the measure of A.

3.1 Polynomial Choice

We select:

T(θ) = cos^2(3π θ) * cos^2(6π θ)

Verification:

T(0) = 1 ✅

T(±s) = 0 ✅

T(θ) ≥ 0 ✅

Fourier coefficients are rationalizable, enabling constructive analysis.

3.2 Fourier Expansion

T(θ) = (1/4) * (1 + (3/2) cos(6π θ) + cos(12π θ) + (1/2) cos(18π θ))

All coefficients non-negative; degree ≤ 12 for relevant Fourier modes.

Measure Integral

∫_0^1 T(θ) dθ = (1/4)∫_0^1 1 dθ + (3/8)∫_0^1 cos(6π θ) dθ + (1/4)∫_0^1 cos(12π θ) dθ + (1/8)∫_0^1 cos(18π θ) dθ

All integrals of cosines over [0,1] vanish, yielding:

μ(A) ≤ 1/4 = 0.25

Chromatic Number Bound

From the measure upper bound:

k ≥ 1/μ(A) = 1/0.25 = 4

This reproduces the known best single-circle lower bound for the chromatic number.

Discussion

The polynomial construction is explicit and analytic, requiring no numerical LP solver.

The method can be generalized by increasing the degree N or considering multiple overlapping circles (Type II approach).

This framework is entirely constructive, showing a pathway to stronger bounds by careful trigonometric design.

Harmonic analysis and Delsarte’s method yield rigorous results in geometric graph theory.

Conclusion

We have formalized a Type I analytic bound for the Hadwiger–Nelson problem using a single-circle trigonometric polynomial. This method demonstrates:

Explicit polynomial construction vanishing at forbidden shifts.

Rigorous integration to bound admissible measures.

Provable lower bound k ≥ 4 on the chromatic number of the plane.

This construction is fully self-contained and accessible to professional mathematicians.
