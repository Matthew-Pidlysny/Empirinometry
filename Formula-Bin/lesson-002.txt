Sequinor Tredecim Problems
==========================

Here's something for the students.  Pay attention, class!

1.  Basics of Backtracking  

Find p(x) for true .99999 and use the following formula:  p(x) / pᵣ = .99999  

What is pᵣ?  What is x?

2.  Don't Mess Up Now

If a = 2.09, which item is the floor?  What would the Pole-Index (I˷) be if this was a p(x) function?

3.  Come On!

((125 - x) / 4) / x = 5, what is the value of x?

4.  Neckbreaker

If p(x) usually renders repeating decimals, use applicable mathematics and number theory reasoning to assert when p 
will become a non-repeating decimal.

5.  Final Question

If pᵥ can estimate variation by maximum degree, recomplicate the 9 in Epsilon in ANY way, adding whatever terms necessary, to make it a factor of 13 after your tinkering.

=============

Good luck, I expect the same results from all of you approximately, covering for the one base of the final question.  Hand
in to your teacher when finished.
