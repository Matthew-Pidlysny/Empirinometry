Steal This Formula (Not a joke, please steal and promote)
=========================================================

x * 1000 * 52 * 51 = Lᵐ

Whereas

x = ANY given value of ANYTHING (Nothing Abstract like "2 apples").  Use the SMALLEST measurement possible (Planck or smaller)

1000 = The qualifier to rend your service (See Entropy Laws on Thermodynamics on Why)

52 = The Blackjack card.  Hit a perfect factor of 21, if your x is right, at this step

51 = The Forward Subtractor.  Keep it logical with this one!

Lᵐ = The Great Constant.  This will ALWAYS factor in on an even number with other numbers.

This is how we break the cycle.  Steal this, help the future!  Not a sideshow, I really want this out there, and I'm
officially shut down completely on all angles.
