Universal Varia
===============

It's gotta be something like this, and I'll just spill it right here:

(x * y)² # D * L / 0.33 # Σ x + y + x² - y⁷ # Qᴸ * K = √R = z

Whereas

x is amount of space combined between each segment of the variation

y is the electrical bond in volts between each segment of variation (Sum amount)

D is the result of the prior hash

Q is the result of the second hash carried over beyond the summation

L is iteration, primed at 1, incrementing after each hash no matter where it is placed

K is the amount generated from summation in the former hash

R is the value of the former equation

z is the composite value after operations

This SHOULD resolve to z being 124 or very close, this is why I specified the number
in the first place that way.  Be well and on your guard for variance in the spectrum of
things!  May Foundational Targets come for R!
