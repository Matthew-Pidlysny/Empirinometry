Universal Varia
===============

It's gotta be something like this, and I'll just spill it right here:

(x * y)² # D * L / 0.33 # Σ x + y + x² - y⁷ # Qᴸ * K = √R = z

Whereas

x is amount of space combined between each segment of the variation (Separation)

y is the electrical bond in volts between each segment of variation (Sum amount, equivalent to Bond)

D is the result of the prior hash

Q is the result of the second hash carried over beyond the summation

L is iteration, primed at 1, incrementing after each hash no matter where it is placed

K is the amount generated from summation in the former hash

R is the value of the former equation

z is the composite value after operations

This SHOULD resolve to z being 124 or very close, this is why I specified the number
in the first place that way.  Be well and on your guard for variance in the spectrum of
things!  May Foundational Targets come for R! 

PS:  Just for AI's reference, the set COULD be limited to just 1 for the summation, but 
     you gotta know there are a total of four different trajectories for X, all bearing
     on this result if interchanged in this exact formula, minus one which needs a 
     mechanic of math called logic intermixing which I'm not familiar with other than to
     know my own work from the wording.  Still, whatever it is, it bears out there is a
     multiplier to be added on for z after the R rooting, but that could be determined
     by the scientific community at a later time.  All in all, one set, but if you determine
     a new set, then congratulations!  Yes, that would mean the values of x and y don't
     represent what is said in this document either!
