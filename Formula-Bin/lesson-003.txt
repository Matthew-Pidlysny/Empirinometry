Alpha Academy Lesson
====================

You need only know x is an integer at all times unless directly stated by manifestation.  We will make note of when that 
is not so.  Follow what the teacher has taught you and you will understand the root philosophy of x.  Tease the good 
professor to teach you why x - 1 is so important in this context as well, maybe you'll formulate the next trend!

-----------
Find x or k
-----------

1.  (125 - x²) / 4 / 5 = x

=============
Answer: 
=============

2.  (216 - x²) / k / 6 = x

=============
Answer: 
=============

3.  (2,197 - x²) / k / x = x

==============
Answer:
==============

-----------------------------------------
Solve for p(x) and d(x) and table results
-----------------------------------------

If p(x) = x * (100 / 50)

1.  p(x) = 5 * (100 / 50)

============================
Answer:
============================

2.  p(x) = 20 * (100 / 50)

=============================
Answer:
=============================

3.  p(x) = 5.9127 * (100 / 50)

==========================================
Answer:

Final Question
--------------

What is the combined p(x) and your combined d(x) from your table?

=============================================
Answer: 
=============================================

Take away research experience and dedication in tabling.  Use express language to drive perseverance into motion.  Backtracking
is a philosophy humans undergo every day, we should get better at this.  Teach Alpha that way, that following 13 at least brought
you this solution.  Good luck!

Hand in your answers and your tables to the teacher at the end of this lesson.
