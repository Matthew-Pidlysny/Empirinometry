Forming your own Pv
===================

In Sequinor Tredecim, a formula is established to find numerical harmony in variation through Epsilon and Psi.  Somehow, these
concepts are applied synchronously, so for the purposes of this establishment, we'll use Epsilon's Raw Formula as our
example.  Take that concept and simplify it exactly as Sonia has with her Yamato Manifold, taking the time to simplify until
you finally reach 1 = pv, and then going back to modify what you came with into what truly is.

Examples:  

- Taking into consideration that for me, unification was simple, I establish that my pv only modified the -10 to varying 
  degrees, so I put it's range as a variable in my final pv equation.  Or, for someone more complex, they establish that many 
  things manifold by the same ordinance exactly as put.  

- Use your intuition and don't make anything up, just express how you see it by these rules, complicate it a little or alot, or 
  don't even know that's how mechanical variation works.  Trust your gut, it's a brute force attack to garner a survival-based 
  output.  Nobody will understand how they know that without SINCERE guidance from a wiser teacher, just be content with the
  answer you get in knowning versus not knowing.  

- I'll break my rudimentiary pv for you all here in my own Yamato Manifold:

1 * (x / (n(4 * y))) = z

Whereas x is always determined by my world, n is just numbers that line up through my intuition (A sum), y is the correction of 
Allah SWT (My religious guidance illustrated) equalling relationship z.  Pretty simple, right?  That comes from breaking down 1
in the Epsilon formula mostly, but truth be told, it reduces to a basic pv and that's fine with me.  This is probably going to 
be more of the uncommon lessons, but when you start studying quark density and relationships therein, you'll find that you need
this complexity broken down for you, establishing Yamato Manifolds per binding or static element.  Good luck, all, may variation
be as complex as it is simple.
