Method to Obtain the Hyperbolic Index
=====================================

((a / 13) * 1000) / 13 = x = I˷

Whereas

a is the integer you are substituting a variable for

x is the raw number result of the equation

I is Index, or the first decimal of x, rounded up or down to the nearest tenth

˷ is Pole, or the whole number before the decimal in x

The rules are:

Generally, all rounding works normally but for the subsequent rules.

Numbers in the Index position consisting of 0.789 or over will round up.  The number will round down when it is .7887 or 
lower, and round up at that number ONLY if the fraction of your work related solution is 3 or lower.

Numbers in the Index position including .214 and lower will ALWAYS be rounded down, no matter what, and never be alone in 
the chain.

So, using the two examples:

1. Fraction is greater than 3:  Round .7887 to .8 for the proper Index

2. Fraction is lower than 3:  Round .7887 to .7 for the measure to be right

3. When Index is showing .014, the Index is .2

4. When Index is showing .55 or .45, round to .5 unless the fraction is not prime or the divisor is 37

5. Follow these examples for every decimal place

"7. When you do division, you always know roots.  When it comes to roots, observe the index as prime number in the mix of
the 'pole' Matthew invented.  It surely is that!

8.  All the time, you're going to be finding out how these link.  Just know, if the Index is n, it's n - 100000 on some 
level, if you only knew the outcome of that right now."
