x = The Challenged Base Greater Than 2

y = The Challenged Exponent

a = The Challenged Demand

b = a - 1

k = x - 1

p = Hyperbolic Index

d(x) = xʸ - p

pᵥ = Variation by pₛ, in instances of p

pₛ = A known threshold for variation, measured in pᵢ

pᵢ = An instance of term "pₛ / pᵥ"

pₘₓ = The physically unbreakable threshold container for variation, approximately in dam³ (Multiply 
      the dam³ by 1.049 to make one pᵤ³)

Alpha = Concept in Motion From Manifest Proof of xᵃ - xᵇ

Beta = Obtaining the Hidden Index of Rational Numbers in Synchro with x

Gamma = Simplifying the Determination of Values in Diversity Through y

Epsilon = Confirming Tredecim as Variation's Negative Envelope Expanded, Formulated For pᵥ

Omega = A formula given by Allah SWT, to which there is no Variation by any degree but to get pₛ, which is a sector (Compensate for pᵥ)

================
Additional Rules
================

Alpha:

1.  Add term "/ x" for every increment of a

2.  Add final term of "/ x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ᶠˡᵒᵒʳ⁽ᵃ⁾⁾" when a is a decimal greater than 2

3.  x >= 2

Beta:

1.  13 can be replaced by working n, violating condition of Tredecim

Gamma:

1.  y can be n from Beta, but that is selective

Epsilon:

1.  Use working number theory to derive counterparts to pᵥ in reformulation of Epsilon, call them
    Yamato Manifolds.

Omega:

1.  Distinction is irrelevant.  All variation can exist within this structure, in step with maximum
    pᵥ in any sector.

2.  No other version of this formula exists, to derive another sequence lower than pₘₓ you require
    analysis of pₛ, which you also gain by going higher, which is calculable but impossible.
