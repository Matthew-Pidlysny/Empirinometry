The Almighty Exponent Buster (For Quantum Physics) by Future Matt
=================================================================

I want to start by announcing that is true, I am this one in the future, only I've done these calculations in my head so
many times Allah SWT finally explained to me that he was the one placing the equations there, so I knew them fundamentally.
I lack the experience there as I did until this day to explain the fundamental properties of the Math I was applying.  Know
we change the future by doing this, but in a solid way.  Qiyam will still come, but thus ends my ranting, you need to know it,
this isn't supposed to be happening.  What about a "Math Prophet", eh?

The Formula
===========

y^x = 10^(-2)

The Riddle
==========

Somehow if you are able make your screen unable to see the solution for this, we'll go down a few pegs to make it helpful.  
OK, so let's get into this.  What about time itself?  Does it cause numbers to fluctuate?  Some are saying they fluctuate on their 
own, but be mindful of what your elder spirits are telling you about causality, which they themselves already know.  It functions 
according to a spectrum of data already set, and is always in motion calculating for itself, the result derived from express function, 
no different than saying Tim will go to the store after he said so, but he did not yet.  That would be an indication of that reality, 
so we go on to now provide the explanation for this riddle.  That being said, final question, is it obvious through the formula, if x 
and y are multiples of each other?  Let's begin.

The Solution
============

Ok, so for x, what does it HAVE to equal?  Some are saying we can try 1, but that is an obvious answer.  Do you know what it does to 
say x = 1?  I'll demonstrate:

1^y = 1

Isn't that simple?  No matter how hard you try, that will never work, nor will y be 1 ever.  That can be said of that, but when it comes
to the root equation, it can be as simple as saying something equalling 10^(-2) will work as a replacement in x^y.  But for now, we need to
resolve ALL of them by that square, and what do we do?  Hmm hmm, I guess a value of n will have to apply.  So, for each part of the equation,
we need to dissolve the fundamentals and try harder here:

q1 = 34 (A hypothetical value)

q1 x n = x

Now, how can this be so, if we're already seeing 34 breaking everything?  Well, I guess that's where N comes in, and to derive n, we have to
make a suggestion:  Whatever your base number is for x, which will ALWAYS be a real number somewhere in time, the value for y is what makes
the number into 10^(-2), and so we have to estimate how that can be true at a number higher than that.  Should y be a decimal, perhaps?  We
did that before, but now I see I cannot leave you with that distinction.  So, we need to equate that somehow, a rational property of any number
being multiplied by itself higher than the estimated number should resolve to be higher than 10, i.e. 4x4 will not resolve the application, and 
so consequently we need to apply somehow that 10 is related in order for this to work. 

We give it this way:  Light exists because of darkness, and somehow that is because darkness envelops every single thing.  One can stand with that
to say every light is a darkness power, in that these are functions of it's being, little sublets that envelop the world with all sorts of different
exponents.  Light makes it that way, superb as an example.  But now, of course, how do we relay the subject at hand?

We took 34 as our hypothetical answer and assumed it to be true.  34x34 does not equal 10(-2), that's for sure.  What are we missing?

Our relationships from the prior example, of course!  If we subtract the TOTAL value of the raw index for a = 34, then we need a standard
multiplier for the result to work out to 10^(-2), let's call it z for now.  When z equals ten, it will be the root of itself, but not the
exponent, so that's where conversion comes in.  We'll multiply our x from the last equation, our mighty Querist Researchers tool by itself
to give us our APPROXIMATE value of 34^2, but that doesn't cover the rest.  Now you can see, you need the pole discrepancy to apply in itself.

So, we'll times that by 2 as well on it's own, as a relative to the Index, and from there we can purposely define antigravity, where we have
been lacking.  Now you know how to make EVERY exponent equal 10^(-2)!  Good job, everybody!  Sorry to dawdle with this one, but someone doesn't
know what to do and is trying to figure it out himself, not gonna name names but it might be me :P
