E + I + R = va^168 = Q

Q * R / I^E = W

W * C^L # [Sigma]2x * x^4 # D^K * L = O

Whereas

E equals total volts as summed by discernable item

I equals amperage summed between discernable items

R equals resistance summed between discernable items

C is the speed of light

L is iteration, primed at 1 and incrementing per hash, no matter where placed

D is the result of the first hash

K is the summation from the second hash

va is primed at 124, modified to the 168th mechanical power in this case

Q is the SUMMED VOLTAGE

W is the PRIMED VOLTAGE

O is the FINAL VOLTAGE
