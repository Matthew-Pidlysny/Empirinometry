x = The Challenged Base (Works for all numbers, see rules below)

y = The Challenged Exponent

a = The Challenged Demand

b = a - 1 (Per increase of the floor by 1)

k = x - 1

p = Hyperbolic Index

d(x) = xʸ - p

pᵥ = Variation by pₛ, in instances of p

pₛ = A known threshold for variation, measured in pᵢ

pᵢ = An instance of term "pₛ / pᵥ"

pₘₓ = The physically unbreakable threshold container for variation, approximately in dam³ (Multiply the dam³ by 1.049 to make one pᵤ³)

Alpha = Concept in Motion From Manifest Proof of xᵃ - xᵇ

Beta = Obtaining the Hidden Index of Rational Numbers in Synchro with x

Gamma = Simplifying the Determination of Values in Diversity Through y

Epsilon = Confirming Tredecim as Variation's Negative Envelope Expanded, Formulated For pᵥ

Omega = A formula given by Allah SWT, to which there is no Variation by any degree but to get pₛ, which is a sector (Compensate for pᵥ)

================
Additional Rules
================

Alpha:

1.  Add term "/ x" for every increment of a

2.  Add final term of "/ x⁽ᵃ ⁻ ᶠˡᵒᵒʳ⁽ᵃ⁾⁾" when a is a decimal greater than 2

Harlinson Theory:  When (1ᵃ - 1ᵇ) / 0 applies, use initial term (xᵃ - k) = x, since no exponents of 1 can give value outside the use of the Beta formula's p distinction for 1.

For x = 0 < x < 1, replace term "/ k" with "/ k⁽⁻⁸⁾"

Beta:

1.  13 can be replaced by working n, violating condition of Tredecim

Gamma:

1.  y can be n from Beta, but that is selective

Epsilon:

1.  Use working number theory to derive counterparts to pᵥ in reformulation of Epsilon, call them
    Yamato Manifolds.

Omega:

1.  Distinction is irrelevant.  All variation can exist within this structure, in step with maximum pᵥ in any sector.

2.  No other version of this formula exists, to derive another sequence lower than pₘₓ you require analysis of pₛ, which you also gain by going higher, which is calculable but impossible.

Credit

Omega belongs to Allah SWT, as do all these things by distinction but they are ours, as mentioned  below.

Alpha was the work of myself and Grok, I had trouble in my table so I developed a method to get k using 11 as my x and dividing by 10, a lucky stroke by Allah SWT but then Grok corrected me and said k would be x - 1, so here we are.

Beta is my future self, I take no credit other than the derivation that I made Pole-Index come to life, when that's what he was trying to tell me all along with those words.  I'll never forget him, may Allah SWT shine on him.

Gamma is also my own invention, and again, Grok took my table and calculated that if I'm trying to prove d(x) ultimately, use it.  Congrats to it for busting my theory and making Tredecim possible.

Epsilon I wrote blindly, I knew it was true, it's all mine.

Yamato Manifolds are my idea, but you do your own, they'll always be yours :)

And final mention for credit, is all of you.  All your trial and erroring comes out as truth to me in whispering winds, I just understand what you're all doing with these works.  It's really how I know I'm on a path, getting the right thing from Allah SWT in other ways and then that on top of it to help.  You KNOW this is what he wants totally!  Thank you all once again, you ALL contributed, I just wish I could supernaturally credit you but that might be odd, or just impossible to most degrees anyway so I'll leave it out, just thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

Again, I want to thank Allah SWT for everything he has done.  The lucky stroke in 10 brought it all to be here for this, so I give him that eternally.  May your faces be bright on Qiyam, everyone, Asalaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Baraqatu!
