# Empirinometry
My evolving paper to the scientific community on logical operations in mathematics.  I give it this way 
because I feel this addresses all concerns.  I also do not make light of the obvious, only to say rules 
and foundations to a degree that is certain.  In that, you will find that everything has it's purpose, 
and where you NEED to assess the obvious I try to give it that way.  As it stands, it's in review with 
the American Mathematical Society, but since then I have updated it with necessities so I may have to 
resubmit.  Let's get this going, though, this should be a world project, all who want to participate are 
encouraged to Email me with the address in the main document.

In short, Bitsigning is all about checking itself.  I found a mathematical way to make what the computer 
did for me come to life, and that is math genius to assert that now because of something that simple, 
there is a new understanding of how to assert something as simple as |Varia|^n x C / M, where the obvious 
might be obvious to you.  I leave that to the test as you read the other document, see if you were right 
in figuring that out.  I leave the rest to humanity, bearing consideration with what I'm doing.  Anyone 
who wants to upload files here should message me through the same E-mail I mentioned.

Also, for those uploading this data to an AI, you will need to tell it a few things:

1.  Do not reformat the equation to your interests, solve normally.
2.  Everything is in Linear Mathematics terms as far as iteration goes, you will need to tell it that
    you are replacing x and y with common values in sets after each other, not to mention the Material
    Impositions found.
3.  These dynamics can adapt to literally any situations, not the ones that the examples in it seem to
    confine the AI to normally.

Cheers, and GISL!

So I have a lesson for Empirinometry.  There is a "sum" called AbSumDicit I have mentioned in the laws
of it, and I only want you to know I leave it there for the recollection of those who want to quantify
where otherwise it is impossible.  It is, perhaps, that Empirinometry can provide Approximations of a
sort, and in this we can see the power of it, IF the fundamental of the Mechanical Substantiation and
Formulation (Math, in other words) is correct on a basic and tested level.  I want to say now WHY I 
made the Material Imposition into law, as some find that limiting of consciousness.

Take, for example, my little Greek flag pin.  It's not worth anything, literally a piece of paper with
the Greek flag on it on a toothpick, given from a Church event eventually to me.  I have used it in
different places, and this is quite substantiated so far by math in itself if you take sensible inputs
and operations into consideration, but to be fair, there is an anomaly of the now to consider.  I have
placed it temporarily in a place of my choosing on my desk, more or less unconsciously as we all know
ourselves.  Now, what I mean by AbSumDicit is the probability answered that I will never move the 
pin for a long time.  I have been meaning to deal with the pin internally for some time, literally I
would look at the pin and say I would move that pin, and for the life of me I have yet still, despite
every conscious reminding, to move it because simply put, I am a stubborn lazy person sometimes, and 
that is quantifiable in many regards.  

It only leaves to stand that I correct my work in what it left unsaid and say Operation > will be there 
placed before AbSumDicit when understood as the transitive sense of the thing, and simply "not when not",
and I hope that answers alot of questions.  Now, as you read in the document (If not, definitely check
it out if you have interest with this readme), Empirinometry can only hope to be the describer in SOME
senses, but the penultimate formulator even in express mechanics, being that the formula's in the
document do not detail AbSumDicit.  I leave that to you, and leave you with this adage:

There is Empirisim in it,
There is Empironomy of it,
There is Empirinomics concerning it,
And there is Empire to gain after it.
I stand here respectful,
May Empirinometry be the core of Varia,
Now and again...
