# Empirinometry
My evolving paper to the scientific community on logical operations in mathematics.  I give it this way 
because I feel this addresses all concerns.  I also do not make light of the obvious, only to say rules 
and foundations to a degree that is certain.  In that, you will find that everything has it's purpose, 
and where you NEED to assess the obvious I try to give it that way.  As it stands, it's in review with 
the American Mathematical Society, but since then I have updated it with necessities so I may have to 
resubmit.  Let's get this going, though, this should be a world project, all who want to participate are 
encouraged to Email me with the address in the main document.

In short, Bitsigning is all about checking itself.  I found a mathematical way to make what the computer 
did for me come to life, and that is math genius to assert that now because of something that simple, 
there is a new understanding of how to assert something as simple as |Varia|^n x C / M, where the obvious 
might be obvious to you.  I leave that to the test as you read the other document, see if you were right 
in figuring that out.  I leave the rest to humanity, bearing consideration with what I'm doing.  Anyone 
who wants to upload files here should message me through the same E-mail I mentioned.

Cheers, and GISL!
